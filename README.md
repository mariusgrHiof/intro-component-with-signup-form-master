## My process

I started to structure the HTML and then adding CSS. Then I started to add JavaScript to handle inputs from the user. In the end, I created media queries to make the site responsive on tablet and mobile devices.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Netlify

### What I learned

I've learned how to validate inputs from the user.

### Continued development

I'm going to enhance my JavaScript skills by continue creating more interactive sites.
